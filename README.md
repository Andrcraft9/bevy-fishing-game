# Bevy Game Project

A modular 2D game prototype built with the Bevy game engine, demonstrating clean architecture and separation of concerns following Rust best practices.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── main.rs          # Entry point and game setup
├── constants.rs     # Game constants
├── items.rs         # Item system
├── layer.rs         # Object spawning system
├── components.rs    # ECS Components
├── events.rs        # Game events
├── states.rs        # Game states
└── systems.rs       # Game systems
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo package manager
